<p>To connect to a print server you can copy the server name in the Run command line of your computer by clicking on Start / Run, then click OK.<br />**If an office is not listed that a user is currently located at, the office has not been identified as having a print server solution and will most likely connect directly to a printer or via TCP IP port configuration. If you discover a location that does have a static printer server that is online and supplying the print server functions for an office, please let IT know so we can update this document.<br />Thank you,<br />IT Global Service Desk - http://HELP - helpdesk@polycom.com</p>
