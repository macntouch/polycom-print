To connect to a print server you can copy the server name in the Run command line of your computer (Win + R).
**If an office is not listed that a user is currently located at, the office has not been identified as having a print server solution and will most likely connect directly to a printer or via TCP IP port configuration. If you discover a location that does have a static printer server that is online and supplying the print server functions for an office, please let me know by leaving an issue with the location name and run command.
